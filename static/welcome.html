            <font size="5" color="darkblue">The ToolFactory uses ordinary Galaxy forms to generate real Galaxy tools.</font></br>
            Complicated tools need a skilled developer using the recommended software. Simple tools can be very useful when you need them, and most simple script based tools can be created by capable developers who have
            not yet acquired the specialised skills, using this special Galaxy server. It generates new tools, from existing scripts of any kind, by filling in a Galaxy form. </br>
            <strong>Note: the ToolFactory is a terrible way to get a script working properly!</strong>. Get it working in a shell, with small test data samples on your local machine first.
            Those working test files are needed in your history. Once uploaded, they are sample inputs for the ToolFactory form. They also become tool test data in the generated Toolshed ready archive file.</br>
            <strong>Dysfunctional, broken scripts make dysfunctional broken tools</strong> so only start a new tool when the new script works correctly on your command line with small test data</br>
            </br> <font size="5" color="darkblue">The preinstalled examples show some of the ways that different tool patterns can be created.</font></br>
            The ToolFactory can turn any <strong>working script</strong> into an ordinary, shareable Galaxy tool and Toolshed ready archive.
            Examples include (trivial) scripts for diverse interpreters including Lisp, Prolog, Bash, Python and R. Any conda dependency can be run and a command line constructed, or entered as an over-ride string, as in the BWA examples<br/>
            For any generated tool in the history, use the redo button <font color="green">⭮</font> to recreate the ToolFactory form settings used. Change things to experiment, or to create tools you could use.
            To create a distinct, new tool from an existing one, change the Tool ID before executing. Otherwise the existing tool with that ID will be overwritten when the ToolFactory runs.
            Generated tools will appear on the local tool menu. Refresh your local browser window to see them, after the ToolFactory job has completed.
             </br>
            <font size="5" color="darkblue">Only simple tools can be generated by the ToolFactory code</font></br>
            Galaxy's UI is not ideal for building tools with dozens of parameters and dozens of files. Some advanced features such as conditionals are not supported.</br>
            Better to build complicated tools requiring those features in the usual manual way, with the specific skills. </br>
            <a href="https://training.galaxy.lazarus.name/training-material/topics/dev/tutorials/tool-from-scratch/tutorial.html"> Training is available</a>, for those skills. The
            ToolFactory may be handy for creating useful simple Galaxy tools from your own working scripts until those skills are available</br>
